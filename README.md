First Capstone - Galvanize Fev/2018

I used the data extracted from the American Fact Finder website https://factfinder.census.gov/ to evaluate statistical data on the population of the United States by separating information by municipality.

When analyzing the data I identified a difference in the percentage of seniors in the population of the counties and I decided to study which factors could be influencing this variation.

I noticed that counties with more than 50,000 people had a lower percentage of seniors than counties with fewer than 50,000 people.

I checked this information and confirmed its significant difference statistically speaking I tried to add to my analysis information that could explain this difference.

As can be observed in the work, the model to be improved needs the inclusion of other information by county that unfortunately I did not find at the moment. I suggest information about climate, cost of living, violence, relief, diseases and other characteristics that may influence this variation.
